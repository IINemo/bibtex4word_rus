# bibtex4word_rus
The easy to install bibtex4word scripts that are compatible with Russian gost styles.

Run install_all.bat <path to folder you want to install scripts>. The installation script will  
1) download and copy bibtex4word in a startup MS Word diretory;  
2) copy scripts for better handling of cyrillyc bibliography lists;  
3) set BIBEXE environment variable.

This works for Windows 10 and presumably for Windows 7 and 8.
